 ### _NEW!_ [WCAG 2 vs APCA Contrast Shootout](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/069a4079b0de2930e72d5401bde9af98#wcag-2-vs-apca-contrast-shootout)
 A gist answering some recent questions regarding APCA, and comparisons and examples of the old (WCAG 2 1.4.3) and the new WCAG 3 with APCA.

### _Contrast_ 
 
Part I:[**Orange You Wondering About Contrast?**](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/1dadb6dcac596f1cd7a5686a076f697f) Answering some contrast questions, and demonstrating a real solution to the infamous orange conundrum.
 
Part II:[**The Lighter Side of Dark Backgrounds**](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/c30dba273aa5eca426ad9f5200917c9d) An article comparing some parts of APCA with the old WCAG 2 contrast methods.

### _Color_

Part I:[**For The Luv of Color**](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/47c793f8a054041bd2b52caa7ad5271c#file-fortheluvofcolor-md) An article comparing CIE Lab and Luv colorspaces

Part II:[**Will Work for Color**](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/10caff6a68e844591e83eadeebfb4347) A follow up article on working spaces and related considerations. Introduces the concept of "Web Working Spacelets".

[**COLORSPACES - The Primal Frontier**](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/b21c2621072b93d3a7c1ef8939bc2adb) A brief Look at the math that helps model how we see. 


### _General_
**On PASSWORDS:** [**0u+_W!+h_+h3_01d-InWithTheNew!**](https://gist.github.com/Myndex/d71875ea431c88db3a22962e28abd164) In other words, "Out With The Old - In With The New" a realistic discussion on password security, with a more realistic approach to reducing "crackability". HINT: we've all been doing it wrong, LOL.

## My Repos
 
 [**SAPC and APCA**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA) The WCAG3/Silver Contrast Method and Algorithm. This is the canonical source for the latest version of APCA.
 
 [**SeeLab**](https://github.com/Myndex/SeeLab) This is a library for sRGB colorstring parsing and CIE processing. Includes XYZ, xyY, Lab, Luv, LCh and more!
 
 [**TinyTrim**](https://github.com/Myndex/TinyTrim) This is a CSS sheet of terse classes, useful for quick adjustments without having to add a `style=""` great for site development when you have a client watching and breathing down your back, LOL.
 
 [**C**olor-ea**SS**y](https://github.com/Myndex/Color-eaSSy) Color-eaSSy is a CSS color stylesheet with a terse but easy to use methodology for color classes — in development, some of this is in TinyTrim

## My Issues and Comments

[**Here is an INDEX**](https://github.com/Myndex/Myndex/blob/main/IssuesIndex.md) of some of the larger and in-depth issue threads or posts I've created or been involved in on GitHub, which may contain  useful information and research. Some of the information here may be superseded as some of these thread date back to the beginnings of the contrast research project. I'm making this list largely for myself to collate the still relevant information into a single FAQ or similar explainer document. Someday.

### The Art and Science of Applied Probability

In this career, I was using Applied Probability Methodologies for the Risk Assessment of short term ROI predictions related to high-variance cash-flow opportunities in finite-sized non-cooperative bidding groups where information is obliquely concealed as a function of multivariate strategies facilitating the predominately range-based tactics driven by randomized but nevertheless deterministic outcomes.
