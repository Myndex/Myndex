## APCA Peer Review & Third Party Discussion
### _Peer reviews of APCA and third party <br>comparisons of APCA vs WCAG&nbsp;2_
There are several independent researchers evaluating APCA, and additional third party comparitive reviews that include demonstrations of the functional superiority to existing methods. The first two listed below are technical reviews by peers evaluating the APCA math and methods, and in comparison to WCAG 2 contrast methods and guidelines. APCA is open for peer review and discussion—please contact us if interested in performing an evaluation.

- [Color Contrast Is Not As Black And White As It Seems ](https://medium.com/@think_ui/why-color-contrast-is-not-as-black-and-white-as-it-seems-94197a72b005) by Roger Attrill, a technical analysis of some of the problems with WCAG 2 contrast math, and comparing and analysing APCA.

### Recognizing issues with WCAG 2 Contrast: <br>_Discussion with links to third party articles_ 
The problems of 4.5:1 as a target for a guideline not only impact those with impairments, but impact standard vision as well. WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast SCs affect 100% of sighted users. The inherent problems with the WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast math have been known for some time and [widely critisized](https://macwright.com/2019/03/30/color-contrast-is-a-problem.html). Including studies [by others showing that color insensitive types](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/03/22/orange-you-accessible-mini-case-study-color-ratio/) are not well served. The WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast specs often cause enough problems for designers [that it is ignored](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/the-myths-of-color-contrast-accessibility/) and today, some 86% of websites are failing WCAG\_2 contrast per an automated survey—though some of these failures are not due to actual poor accessibility, but due to the perceptual inaccuracies of WCAG\_2 contrast.

### _The Art and Science of Applied Probability_
In this career, I was using Applied Probability Methodologies for the Risk Assessment of short term ROI predictions related to high-variance cash-flow opportunities in finite-sized non-cooperative bidding groups where information is obliquely concealed as a function of multivariate strategies facilitating the predominately range-based tactics driven by randomized but nevertheless deterministic outcomes.

### _Welcome to the very bottom of the page!_
Here at the very bottom of the page, we dare to ask the question, **_"do two lights make a dark?"_**

Also, just **how many color scientists** does it take to rotationally engage the helical conducting threads of an illumination apparatus further composed of a sealed, evacuated glass envelope containing a plurality of filament holders which electrically connect and physically support a coiled electrically conducting but resistive filament preferentially fabricated from a tungsten alloy to the aforementioned helical threads, engaging into a helical conducting receptacle, such that when an electrical power source of sufficient voltage and current is applied, said filament shall be caused to incandesce and emit visible irradiance? <br>
A: The answer is "none" because they fell asleep reading this joke.
