 ## My Repos
 
 [**SAPC and APCA**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA) The WCAG3/Silver Contrast Method and Algorithm. This is the canonical source for the latest version of APCA.
 
 [**SeeLab**](https://github.com/Myndex/SeeLab) This is a library for sRGB colorstring parsing and CIE processing. Includes XYZ, xyY, Lab, Luv, LCh and more!
 
 [**TinyTrim**](https://github.com/Myndex/TinyTrim) This is a CSS sheet of terse classes, useful for quick adjustments without having to add a `style=""` great for site development when you have a client watching and breathing down your back, LOL.
 
 [**C**olor-ea**SS**y](https://github.com/Myndex/Color-eaSSy) Color-eaSSy is a CSS color stylesheet with a terse but easy to use methodology for color classes â€” in development, some of this is in TinyTrim

## My Issues and Comments

[**Here is an INDEX**](https://github.com/Myndex/Myndex/blob/main/IssuesIndex.md) of some of the larger and in-depth issue threads or posts I've created or been involved in on GitHub, which may contain  useful information and research. Some of the information here may be superseded as some of these thread date back to the beginnings of the contrast research project. I'm making this list largely for myself to collate the still relevant information into a single FAQ or similar explainer document. Someday.

## My Non-GitHub Content

I'm user "Myndex" on Stack, and a bunch of other places. Someday I'll link some relevant things here. Someday.
