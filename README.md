## My Issues and Comments

Some of the larger and in-depth issue threads or posts I've created or been involved in on GitHub, which may contain  useful information and research. Some of the information here may be superceeded as some of these thread date back to the beginnings of the contrast research project. I'm making this list largely for myself to collate the still relevant information into a single FAQ or simielar explainer document.

## My Non-GitHub Content

I'm user "Myndex" on Stack, and a bunch of other places. Someday I'll link some relevant things here. Someday.
