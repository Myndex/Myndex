## Known Issues With WCAG 2 Contrast
### _Discussion with links to third party articles<br>written prior to the development of APCA_ 
The problems of 4.5:1 as a target for a guideline is that it not only impact those with impairments, but impacts standard vision as well. WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast SCs affect 100% of sighted users. The inherent problems with the WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast math have been known for some time and [**widely critisized**](https://macwright.com/2019/03/30/color-contrast-is-a-problem.html). Including studies [**by others showing that color insensitive types**](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/03/22/orange-you-accessible-mini-case-study-color-ratio/) are not well served. 

The WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast specs often cause enough problems for designers [**that it is ignored**](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/the-myths-of-color-contrast-accessibility/) and today, some 86% of websites are failing WCAG\_2 contrast per an automated survey—though some of these failures are not due to poor actual accessibility, but due to the perceptual inaccuracies of WCAG\_2 contrast.

The unfortunate end result is a grave distrust of the WCAG 2.x accessibility standards overall, despite the many other important aspects of those standards.

## The Lighter Side of Math & Photons...

### _The Art and Science of Applied Probability_
In this career, I was using Applied Probability Methodologies for the Risk Assessment of short term ROI predictions related to high-variance cash-flow opportunities in finite-sized non-cooperative bidding groups where information is obliquely concealed as a function of multivariate strategies facilitating the predominately range-based tactics driven by randomized but nevertheless deterministic outcomes.

For the record, Myndex is pronounced:

_mind - ex_      
\ ˈmīn-ˌdɛks \

When George Eastman invented the word "Kodak" one of his criteria was that "it won't be mispronounced".
I guess I missed that day. Ooops.

Just **how many patent attornys** does it take to rotationally engage a helical conducting thread of an illumination apparatus further comprised of a sealed, evacuated glass envelope containing two or more conducting filament holders which electrically connect and physically support a coiled electrically conducting but resistive filament, preferentially fabricated from a tungsten alloy, to the aforementioned helical threads, which further engage into a helical conducting receptacle, such that when an electrical power source of sufficient voltage and current is applied to the receptacle input conducting connectors, the voltage and current is henceforth transferred to the helical conducting threads of the illumination apparatus and thereto across the conducting filament holders and through said filament such that it shall be caused to incandesce and emit visible irradiance according to the laws of blackbody radiators? <br>

**_The Answer as to how many:_  a plurality**
