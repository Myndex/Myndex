### Recognizing issues with WCAG 2 Contrast: <br>_Discussion with links to third party articles_ 
The problems of 4.5:1 as a target for a guideline not only impact those with impairments, but impact standard vision as well. WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast SCs affect 100% of sighted users. The inherent problems with the WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast math have been known for some time and [widely critisized](https://macwright.com/2019/03/30/color-contrast-is-a-problem.html). Including studies [by others showing that color insensitive types](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/03/22/orange-you-accessible-mini-case-study-color-ratio/) are not well served. The WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast specs often cause enough problems for designers [that it is ignored](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/the-myths-of-color-contrast-accessibility/) and today, some 86% of websites are failing WCAG\_2 contrast per an automated survey—though some of these failures are not due to poor actual accessibility, but due to the perceptual inaccuracies of WCAG\_2 contrast.

### _Welcome to the very bottom of the page!_
Here at the very bottom of the page, we dare to ask the question, **_"do two lights make a dark?"_**

Also, just **how many color scientists** does it take to rotationally engage the helical conducting threads of an illumination apparatus further composed of a sealed, evacuated glass envelope containing a plurality of filament holders which electrically connect and physically support a coiled electrically conducting but resistive filament preferentially fabricated from a tungsten alloy to the aforementioned helical threads, engaging into a helical conducting receptacle, such that when an electrical power source of sufficient voltage and current is applied, said filament shall be caused to incandesce and emit visible irradiance? <br>
A: The answer is "none" because they fell asleep reading this joke.
